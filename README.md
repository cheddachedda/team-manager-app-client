## Project Brief

This was a project put together during week 9 of the Software Engineering Immersive course at General Assembly. The basic brief was to build any web application with a group that utilises the skills developed throughout the course so far.

See the full brief here: [Project-Brief.md](https://gist.github.com/wofockham/feb064103988a3d19b8d).

## Development Tools

The client side of this project was created through React which gathers information from a Ruby on Rails database which was also created as part of this project.
